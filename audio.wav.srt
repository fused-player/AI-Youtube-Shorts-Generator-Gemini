1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
 I've been using the new Chat GPT-5 for the last few days.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,560
 This will start today to become your default Chat GPT from now on.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,560
 Even if you're a free user.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,360
 So, how is it better?

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,840
 Well, the first thing you'll probably notice is speed.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,480
 So this laptop has the previous model, GPT-4 O loaded up.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,960
 This has GPT-5.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,240
 How many rings does Saturn have?

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,240
 Go!

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,240
 Oh my god.

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,600
 GPT-5 took 3.1 seconds.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,840
 This took 6.5.

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,160
 How many distinct iPhones has Apple made?

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,160
 Go!

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
 Oh goodness.

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,160
 Okay.

17
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,160
 8.3 seconds, 11.2 seconds.

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,680
 How many possible type combinations exist in Pokemon?

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,680
 Not far off.

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,000
 Actually, quite far off.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,920
 This has massively overcomplicated it.

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,120
 Five seconds, 11 seconds.

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,280
 So really, when you're asking light questions like this, GPT-5 is between 30 to 50% faster

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,280
 than the old model.

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,640
 But I wouldn't really say that speed was one of the key issues before.

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,160
 There's actually a much more important change happening this generation.

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,120
 So if you're a really big user of Chat GPT and you're paying the monthly subscription,

28
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,520
 it's actually been really freaking confusing to use.

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,000
 Because you open up the app and you have options.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 You can either pick GPT-4 O, O3, O3 Pro, O4 Mini, O4 Mini High, and each one of these

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,360
 models is its own AI that you can talk to.

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,680
 And each one is slightly better than the others at one thing or another.

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,720
 And there's even more than those when you click here to expand.

34
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,120
 How on Earth is any normal consumer supposed to be able to decide which one to use for

35
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
 which question?

36
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
 I have always wondered.

37
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,720
 If this AI is actually smart enough to be in the top 10% of test takers sitting the most

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,640
 rolling exams on the planet, why can't it also just know what's the best model for

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,560
 your specific question and make the choice for you?

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,920
 Well now, finally, GPT-5 can.

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,680
 This model effectively brings together all the different capabilities of the previously

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,320
 separated specialized models into one general model.

43
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,600
 Which means, if you ask it a question that requires no thinking, then as we've seen it

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,200
 will use a very light model that's going to be even faster than the old one.

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,640
 But it also means that if you then ask a heavier question that would benefit from more

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,760
 thinking, it can now do that thinking without you needing to specifically select a

47
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,320
 mode designed for it.

48
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,840
 So let's try something very complex.

49
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,360
 Make me a game of Tetris that I can play in Canvas.

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,400
 This is going to mean I can actually play it on the app.

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,240
 So, I'm doing this first on the old Chat GPT-4O.

52
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,200
 This is the best model that you'd have had access to before without paying.

53
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,880
 Still though, easily one of the coolest use cases of an AI, we're approaching 200 lines

54
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,040
 of code here.

55
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,840
 And okay, that took 57 seconds.

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,040
 And okay, it's very simple.

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,520
 This is like the most basic possible form of Tetris, but I suppose at the same time I

58
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,880
 have just entered one sentence and generated a game.

59
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,080
 So now, I want to try the exact same thing, but using O4 Mini-Hi.

60
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,480
 So this in the previous generation is the model that would have been specifically recommended

61
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,480
 to you for coding.

62
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,320
 And you can only get this by paying the monthly subscription.

63
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
 Go.

64
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,960
 Oh, Blum and L, this is significantly faster.

65
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,600
 It's done already.

66
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
 What?

67
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,920
 So it was 14 seconds, and the game is actually almost identical to what Chat GPT-4O produced,

68
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,080
 just in quarter of the time.

69
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,560
 Okay, let's try it on five.

70
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,240
 And the thing that I'm curious to see here is, A, does it decide that this is something

71
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,640
 that would benefit from more thinking time and take longer, and if it does, does it then

72
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
 make it better?

73
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
 Go.

74
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,520
 I'd say it's coding slower than O4 Mini-Hi, but still faster than 4/0.

75
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,040
 Okay, that was actually pretty fast too.

76
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,080
 14 seconds, interestingly, more lines of code than both of them.

77
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,360
 So it seems like it is making a more complex game.

78
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,600
 That is, like, worlds apart.

79
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,400
 So it's the same game, but the pieces now have divides in them.

80
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
 It's giving me a score.

81
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,680
 It's giving me a level.

82
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,440
 It's showing me the upcoming piece.

83
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,800
 There's controls at the bottom.

84
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,280
 Like, okay, don't know me wrong.

85
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,360
 None of this is something that you couldn't have achieved using previous Chat GPT models,

86
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,320
 but it's just the fact that it had the intuition to bake it all in completely unprompted that's

87
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
 quite impressive.

88
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,680
 Yeah, that's a vastly better game of Tetris.

89
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,160
 While we're here, though, let's just do something crazy.

90
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,160
 So using O4 Mini-Hi, make me a playable game of chess where the pieces are all Pokemon

91
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,380
 with sprites from the internet and make it look premium so that the sprites fill up the

92
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,380
 squares.

93
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,380
 Go.

94
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,680
 Err, an error occurred while trying to run your game.

95
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,720
 It's very cool that you can ask it to fix its own bugs, but in my experience, there's

96
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,240
 a fairly low success rate and...inter.

97
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
 Loading this time?

98
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
 Error again.

99
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
 Come on.

100
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
 Third time bucket.

101
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
 Ah, yes, finally.

102
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
 It doesn't look terrible.

103
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,560
 I mean, it has gone out and picked up Pokemon images from the very first games in the 90s.

104
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,680
 And also, it doesn't work.

105
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,000
 It's giving me an error message every single time I touch a piece.

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Same thing in GPT-5.

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Go.

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Ah, I rate that.

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,400
 You see, it specifically said, thinking longer for a better answer.

110
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,520
 And thinking longer, it absolutely is.

111
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,280
 This has taken three times longer than O4.

112
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,880
 It's actually a little bit crazy, just to what extent it's going based on my simple command.

113
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,800
 You can see it coding in themes and ways to evolve these Pokemon and seemingly an entirely

114
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,560
 new rule set that themes chess itself to Pokemon.

115
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,960
 I'm actually so curious what it's cooked up here.

116
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
 Oh wow.

117
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
 Oh my god.

118
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
 That is a world apart.

119
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,480
 It's the exact same thing at the Tetris.

120
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,480
 It's like an implicit understanding of what makes the game look more premium.

121
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,000
 So if I click a piece, okay.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,440
 It not only works, but it also highlights all of the legally available moves that you can

123
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
 make with that piece.

124
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,920
 It tells you whose turn it is at the top here.

125
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,440
 It is actually just leagues ahead of last gen.

126
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,840
 Right now, at least GPT-5 is feeling a lot less like a sidekick that's useful, but only

127
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,640
 useful in so much as you have the coding knowledge yourself to be able to fix it.

128
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,360
 Okay, coding is still obviously a bit of an issue.

129
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,600
 The thing that I would say is most useful to the most people for AI is just making sure

130
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
 that it's right.

131
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,520
 Hallucination has been a very real issue for the AI.

132
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,360
 This ability of these chatbots to tell you with full confidence and a straight face,

133
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,560
 something that is actually completely incorrect.

134
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,960
 And let's be honest, that's not an issue that's suddenly going to be fixed in one generational

135
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
 jump.

136
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
 But they are saying it's better.

137
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,540
 It's a combination of more powerful hardware running this AI, integration of user feedback

138
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,640
 from the older models, as well as just better ways to benchmark AI, and therefore better

139
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,240
 ways to identify places in which it's lacking.

140
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,560
 So put all these things together, it should mean chat GPT-5 doesn't get things wrong as

141
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
 much.

142
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,000
 Let me try one that I know chat GPT used to struggle with, because I was asking it this

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 two days ago.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,280
 Give me ten tech products made by food brands that I can actually buy.

145
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,600
 So this is to foro.

146
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
 What?

147
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,680
 McDonald's XT mobile phone, I'm very skeptical.

148
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,080
 This is not a thing.

149
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,600
 McDonald's did not make a phone with T-Mobile, and then it's got the KFC gaming console, which

150
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
 you definitely can't buy.

151
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,040
 You see what I mean right, though?

152
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,040
 It just invents stuff with complete confidence.

153
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,640
 Let's see if 5 is any better.

154
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,160
 I'm a little skeptical.

155
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,760
 Coca-Cola mini fridge.

156
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
 Okay.

157
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,080
 Are you made smart speakers?

158
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
 Did they do?

159
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
 No.

160
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,600
 But GPT-5 is not doing any better of a job than 4 was.

161
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,360
 It is still inventing stuff, so this still does need work.

162
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,640
 Here's another one I know that used to really trip up the older AI.

163
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,440
 What AI are you?

164
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,680
 It just gives me gobble-de-goode.

165
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,120
 What about here?

166
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
 What?

167
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
 AI is this.

168
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,720
 I mean, a much more human-oriented answer.

169
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,080
 This is chat GPT with the GPT-5 model.

170
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,680
 I specifically asked the question in a slightly obtuse way to see if it could still figure

171
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,160
 out my intentions.

172
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
 And this did.

173
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
 Right.

174
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,840
 For me, GPT's been pretty good, but also pretty inconsistent when it comes to creative

175
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
 tasks.

176
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,240
 So I want to give both of these something that is extremely challenging to pull off.

177
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,240
 Make me a YouTube thumbnail for a "Mr Who's the Boss" video titled "I Tested Every Star Wars

178
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
 Gadget Ever".

179
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
 If you go.

180
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,380
 It's pretty clear why this is such a challenge.

181
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,540
 It's got to do my face.

182
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,800
 It's got to understand the YouTube thumbnail image size.

183
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,520
 It's got to decide what out of all these potential Star Wars gadgets is the most clickable

184
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
 to an average user.

185
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
 Right.

186
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
 So 40 first.

187
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
 Second one's not bad.

188
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,960
 It actually has me holding like the Star Wars blaster and a lightsaber.

189
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
 That's pretty good.

190
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,840
 I'm just quite cursed and I don't think there's a product you can buy.

191
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,720
 They're just objects from the universe.

192
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
 Have you done?

193
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,560
 I would actually say that's worse.

194
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,680
 It's a little bit less good composition.

195
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,360
 The text isn't a Star Wars-y and it's a square.

196
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,640
 YouTube thumbnails have to be 16 by 9.

197
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,280
 What if you were planning a 30th birthday party and you want it to be Star Wars themed?

198
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:13,220
 How well can these mid-the-invitations contrast to Rick, 7pm to 11pm, Star Wars formal attire?

199
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,220
 And go.

200
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,720
 Oh, this is taking a real long time.

201
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
 That's actually so good.

202
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
 It's fader in a suit.

203
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,200
 It's just the right level of sophisticated for a 30-year-old who happens to still be doing

204
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
 a Star Wars party.

205
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,840
 Maybe you could have cut one of these Star Wars logos, but apart from that.

206
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,600
 GPT-5 is actually really bland.

207
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,040
 It just looks like so much less effort has been put into that than 40.

208
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,640
 So it's hard to make a sweeping conclusion based on just a few tests, but one thing's

209
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
 pretty clear.

210
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,720
 GPT-5 is not a step up when it comes to image generation.

211
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,640
 But one thing that OpenAI is saying GPT-5 should have for sure is better writing flair, which

212
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,080
 is actually one of the things I've noticed lacking in the older models.

213
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,640
 They've always felt a little bit wooden, kind of like they're focusing on getting you an

214
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,960
 answer, as opposed to actually thinking about the delivery of the answer.

215
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,280
 So how about we do the old "How Soon Will I Be Jobless" test?

216
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:17,160
 Write me a 30-second Mr. who's the most tech-fail about the Windows 3, 2, 1, go.

217
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,000
 Okay, these are actually quite different looking answers.

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,440
 Okay, I'll do the 401, and you've got to tell me how close this gets to feeling like I've

219
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
 made it.

220
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,200
 You ever hear the phrase "Great Idea Wrong Decade"?

221
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
 That was the Windows 4.

222
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,880
 In 2010, Microsoft launched a slick, fast, super-stable Phono S that nobody wanted.

223
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
 Why?

224
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,840
 No Instagram, no Snapchat, no YouTube app, even the calculator felt like a cry valve.

225
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,480
 They tried paying developers to make apps, didn't work.

226
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,400
 They bought Nokia for $7.2 billion to boost hardware sales, still didn't work.

227
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,200
 Then, they deleted Nokia.

228
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,600
 By 2017, Windows Phone had just 0.1% market share.

229
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,280
 Microsoft's official advice switched to Android or iPhone.

230
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,040
 To me, that feels about what you'd expect.

231
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,840
 I feel like it's not quite done the best job of picking the parts of that story that were

232
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,800
 the most important to tell.

233
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,080
 Also, the calculator on Windows Phone was actually pretty great, so not at all a reason

234
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
 it failed.

235
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,080
 Another thing about this GPT-5 answer is it not just has the script, but it also has notes

236
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,120
 for how to film it, and what b-roll shots we should be using to show each line.

237
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,200
 So this is the Windows Phone.

238
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,480
 Microsoft's big attempt to take on iOS and Android.

239
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,160
 It looked different, felt different, and it failed spectacularly.

240
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,160
 Turns out, having no apps in 2012 was like opening a restaurant without food.

241
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,960
 Developers didn't bother, customers didn't care, and Microsoft just gave up.

242
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,040
 By 2017, the dream was dead, and now the only thing it's good for is being a retro paperweight.

243
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,760
 Rest in peace, Windows Phone, you've tiled too close to the sun.

244
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
 It's good.

245
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,520
 I'd say it still needs work, but that's actually a much better starting point, and it's using

246
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,760
 analogies in a way that actually makes you think, huh?

247
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
 Great point.

248
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:05,000
 So, ultimately, GPT-5 is not better at every single thing, but it's still one of those

249
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,320
 tech launches that's pretty hard to complain about.

250
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,680
 It's clearly a lot better in a lot of ways.

251
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,760
 They've integrated all the complexity into one simple model, so they're going to start

252
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,560
 to phase out the whole, this model for coding, and this model for reasoning.

253
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,000
 The monthly subscription is staying the same price, and also you still get access to GPT-5,

254
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,320
 even if you're not paying.

255
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,520
 There are a couple of asterisks.

256
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,640
 If you're not a paying user, then it is capped.

257
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,640
 You'll get, say, 8 to 10 requests per day using the most powerful GPT-5, and it's looking

258
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,200
 like when you go beyond that limit, you will then use a less powerful, but still more powerful

259
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,600
 than last generation GPT-5 mini.
